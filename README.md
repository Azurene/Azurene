Hello! Welcome to my little space in the internet where I try to code things.
## About Me
I like to imagine that I'm a friendly, helpful, and positive influence in people's lives; though I'll admit my self-esteem could do with some work, as well as my social skills. I'm a second-generation American, raised by parents who both originated from the Philipines. I've lived in New England for a time, but it became apparent that I could take this California-girl out of California, but I couldn't take the California out of the California-girl. And thus, I've returned to never-snow SoCal.
### Hobbies
* Piano
* Crochet
* Writing
* Gaming
* Video editing (rather poorly)
### Plans
* Majoring in Psychology, hoping to complete my graduate degree down the line.
* Completing a Web Development Bootcamp and hope to get a snazzy certification this year.
* Combine the above to either conduct my own research or help other psychologists with theirs.
* Publish a novel.
### Not-So-Interesting Random Facts
* I collect folding fans and lightsabers
* Gluten-free by necessity.
* I have three A.A. General Studies degrees, all of them in a different emphasis.
* My friends have forced a chicken-themed collection on me because of a recurring joke that I'm "the Chicken Queen." It's gotten to the point where I've accepted it as part of my life now.
